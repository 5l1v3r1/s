# What is the grammar of tokens?

TOK ::= WORD | STRING

## words

At the most basic level words are just characters delimited by spaces.
More specifically by any of the chars listed in token_end.

All of: space, tab, newline, # end a token

You can use \ inside a word to put one of those ending characters (or a backslash) in it.

WORD ::= WORDCH +
       | `~` WORDH +

WORDCH ::= '\' <any char>
         | <any char except '\\' ' ' '\t' '\n' '#'>

## strings

STRING ::= SINGLE_QUOTED | DOUBLE_QUOTED

DOUBLE_QUOTED ::= '"' DQ_INNER '"'

DQ_INNER ::= '\\' <anychar>
           | <any char except '\\' '"'>
