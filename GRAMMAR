# GRAMMAR

<command> ::= <token>+

<pipe> ::= <command> '|' <pipe>
         | <command>

<conj> ::= <pipe> '&&' <conj>
         | <pipe>

<disj> ::= <conj> '||' <disj>
         | <conj>

<line> ::= <disj> ('<' <token>)? ('>' <token>)? '&'?

or in words:

A command is a sequence of tokens like: grep -v foo
A pipe is a sequence of commands with | between: ps aux | grep watch | grep -v grep
A disj is a sequence of pipes with || in between, like:  mount /proc || exit -1
note: | binds tighter than && which binds tighter than ||
And each line can optionally be set to run in the background/in parallel using &
you can also (optionally) choose to redirect stdin/out
